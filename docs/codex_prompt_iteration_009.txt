You are adding styling to the app “glance”.

GOAL
Apply a compact, information-dense, Winamp-inspired style using the
PxPlus IBM VGA font, without refactoring layout or components.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT refactor markup or component structure.
- Do NOT introduce a theming/skin system.
- Do NOT change behavior, spacing semantics, or editor logic.
- Only CSS changes are allowed.
- Apply changes incrementally, starting with the Dashboard only.

FONT
- Use PxPlus IBM VGA (free to bundle with the app).
- Bundle the font locally and load via @font-face.
- Apply the font globally to the app.
- Font must be readable at small sizes (10–12px).

STYLE DIRECTION
- Light background (off-white, not pure white).
- Small text + tight spacing.
- Borders ONLY for structural panels (Dashboard sections, History container, Search container).
- Tasks themselves must NOT have borders.
- Notes should feel continuous, not boxed.
- Images are secondary; text density is primary.

TASK VISUAL DISTINCTION
- Task titles should be subtly emphasized:
  - slightly darker color OR slightly higher font weight
- Do NOT add icons, boxes, or heavy separators.

COLORS
- Keep palette minimal.
- Preserve existing highlight colors:
  - green, yellow, red
- Bold must continue to work.
- No gradients, no shadows.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
1) Add PxPlus IBM VGA font files under ui/assets/fonts/.
2) Create a single CSS file (e.g. compact.css).
3) Apply it to the Dashboard only first.
4) Adjust:
   - font-family
   - font-size
   - line-height
   - padding
   - panel borders
5) After Dashboard looks correct, propagate to other views.

Do not touch History/Search/Settings markup unless necessary for styling.
